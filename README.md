# King County Housing Prediction Model
This project uses linear regression to forecast housing prices in King County, Washington.This project leverages a dataset containing various attributes of homes sold in the area, such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, and other relevant features. By applying regression techniques, the model aims to provide accurate predictions that can assist homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Business Problem
The unpredictability of house prices poses a significant challenge for various stakeholders, including potential homebuyers and real estate agents. These stakeholders require accurate and reliable house price predictions to make informed decisions. Homebuyers need to understand market trends to make prudent purchasing decisions while the  real estate agents need accurate data to advise their clients effectively.

## Data 
The dataset used for this project includes housing sales data from King County, Washington, spanning the years 2014 to 2015. Each entry provides essential features of the houses sold, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, and living area size (sqft_living). The dataset also includes the sale price of each house, serving as the target variable for prediction.

## Methods
The project uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), aiming to uncover key patterns and relationships. It provides insights into housing market trends in King County, Washington, from 2014-2015, highlighting influential factors like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms. It also employs linear regression to model the relationship between housing prices and key predictors from the KC Housing dataset. This statistical approach predicts prices based on features such as property size and amenities, aiding stakeholders in strategic decision-making.
